    "To train the network, tensorflow use a format of the data which combine the image and it's xlm label named tfrecord. To convert the voc xml label into tfrecord, they provide a script : /tensorflow-scripts/generate_tfrecord.py that we'll use here. Running this notebook will create the desired tfrecord files. If you want to download them, you can follow the instructions explained below (or in the README.md of the training-workspace/annotations)\n",

    "If you did not install everything, or don't have a compatible version between tensorlfow and object-detection-api, you can stil run this notebook but it is a bit harder. In the case you don't,you'll need to tweek some code in your object-detection-api (replace `tf.gfile` by `tf.io.gfile` in `label_map_util` )."
